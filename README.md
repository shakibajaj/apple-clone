# apple-clone
A responsive Apple website clone built with HTML and Tailwind CSS. It recreates Apple’s clean and modern look, with smooth scaling and consistent styling on desktops, tablets, and phones. This project was a fun way to practice front-end development, responsive design, and utility-first styling while building a sleek, real-world interface.
